''' Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

''''
Logic:
* Use a sliding window and hash map to find all anagrams of p in s.
* Keep a frequency count of characters in p (p_count) and the current window in s.
* Move the window one character at a time across s.
* For each move:
    - Add the new character entering the window from right.
    - Remove the old character leaving the window from left.
* Whenever the current windowâ€™s frequency matches p_count,
  it means we found an anagram â€” store its starting index.
* Continue sliding the window until the end of the string.
